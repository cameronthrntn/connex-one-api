  - ### ðŸš§ Structure

    This API contains 2 endpoints, as outlined in the specification.

    `/time` - Returns the current time from the epoch.

    ```
    { "epoch": number }
    ```

    `/metrics` - Returns a plaintext dump of metrics from prometheus, including both the default and garbage collection metrics.

  - ### ðŸ§ª Testing

    This project makes use of rudimentary asynchronous testing for the available endpoints. These unit tests will ensure correct request headers and present, and that the returned values are accurate.

    To run the tests:

    ```bash
    yarn test
    ```
